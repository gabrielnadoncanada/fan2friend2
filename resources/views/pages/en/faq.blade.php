                </p>
                <p>Since your time is limited, make sure to
                    not ask questions that require long answers. Try to choose one main question you'd like to ask

                    thought you'd like to share.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>You can ask a simple question like "What inspired you to make this movie, create this
                            album, or write this book?"</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>You can also ask a more specific, possibly obscure question to show that you're a true
                            fan. For example, you can ask: "Why do you always end your songs with two claps?" or
                            "What was it like working with Robert Downey Jr. in Avengers?"</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Remember why you're there. By already having meaningful interactions in mind, you'll
                            refrain from shouting "OMG I LOVE YOU ON TV" when you might want to have a more in-depth
                            conversation.</p>

                <p>It's unfortunate and disappointing when an artist cancels their performance. For canceled events,

                    which you've already bought tickets, we do not offer refunds for missed events.</p>
                <p>The only exception is if the event schedule has changed, and you couldn't make it at the new
                    time.</p>
                <p>In this specific case, you can request a refund within 24 hours of the schedule change. After
                    that time, no refunds are possible. While we want to be fair to everyone, this 24-hour period is
                    intended to preserve the integrity of the event.</p>

                <p>Are you experiencing issues with your video meeting and welcome? Your internet connection, or
                    that of the celebrity, is likely the cause. A poor internet connection can result in delays and
                    poor audio and video quality. The following tips should help you.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Ensure you meet the minimum required setup. We continuously improve video quality. For
                        optimal performance, make sure you have the minimum required setup.

                        <p>Check your computer and internet connection.</p>
                        <p>A poor connection can lead to stuttering or frozen videos and poor audio quality. If you
                            have a poor connection, you may receive a notification indicating "Poor network
                            connection." Here are some other factors that can affect the quality of your video
                            meeting and welcome:</p>

                <p>Here are some other factors that can affect the quality of your video meeting and welcome:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensure you have a strong WiFi signal or, if possible, use a wired connection.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Close all applications that may interfere with your call. File-sharing applications,
                            audio or video streaming, or opening multiple browsers can all consume bandwidth.</p>

                        <p>If you are using Fan2Friend on a laptop and it's in power-saving mode, try plugging the
                            laptop into the power source or switching it to maximum performance mode.</p>

                <p>Step 1: Allow Licenses</p>
                <p>You must grant Fan2Friend permission to access your camera and microphone to participate in
                    certain Fan2Friend experiences.</p>

                <p>Step 2: Check Your Hardware</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Make sure your microphone, camera, and speakers are plugged in and turned on on your
                            computer (the microphone should not be in "Mute" mode).</p>
                        <p>If you are connecting any of your devices via USB, check if you need to install
                            manufacturer software for the device. Step 3: Check Your Settings</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensure that other programs on your computer are not using your microphone, camera, or
                            speakers.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Step 3: Check Your Settings<br><br>1. When entering your event, you should be prompted to select
                    and test your camera, microphone, and speaker.<br>2. Ensure the correct device is selected for
                    each setting (change it using the dropdown arrow):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Camera: If your camera is working, you will see your video at this stage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Microphone: To test your microphone, speak aloud, and you should see the audio meter
                            move. Ensure that your microphone is the default recording device, and recording levels
                            are correct: Windows / Mac</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Speakers: To test your speakers, click on Test Sound.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If your hardware and settings are correct and you still encounter issues, restart your
                        browser.

                    <li>
                        <p>If the problem persists, switch to a different browser.</p>
                        <p>Firefox / Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge / Safari</p>
