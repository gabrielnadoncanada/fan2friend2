            <x-text as="h2" theme="h3">Purchase of an Event</x-text>

            <p>For purchases containing an event, refunds are possible up to 7 days before the original event date you
                purchased. Beyond this deadline, no refunds are possible. When an event you purchased is full, no
                refunds are possible for that event. While we aim to be fair to everyone, our refund policy is designed
                to preserve the integrity of each event.</p>

            <x-text as="h2" theme="h3">Refunds After the Experience</x-text>

            <p>Once you have experienced your event, there are no refunds. If you encountered an issue during your
                experience, please contact us.</p>

            <x-text as="h2" theme="h3">Purchase of Multiple Events</x-text>

            <p>It is solely your responsibility to assess the risk of purchasing multiple events with close start times.
                No refunds will be granted for missed events due to double booking or scheduling conflicts.</p>

            <x-text as="h2" theme="h3">You Missed Your Event</x-text>

            <p>There are no refunds for missed events. You must be available at the scheduled time of purchase. If you
                miss your event, we will try to place you in another event of equal/similar value, but there is no
                guarantee that we will be able to do so since all events are subject to availability.</p>

            <x-text as="h2" theme="h3">Event Schedule Changes</x-text>

            <p>Event schedules are subject to change. It is your sole responsibility to stay informed about any schedule
                changes.</p>

            <x-text as="h2" theme="h3">Canceled and Rescheduled Events</x-text>

            <p>In the event of a cancellation, you can contact us for a refund to your original payment method or
                request to be rescheduled to another event of similar value. In the event of a schedule change for an
                event, you will be automatically rescheduled to the new date or, upon request, we will offer you the
                option to enroll in another event of similar value.</p>
            <x-text as="h2" theme="h3">Event Preparation</x-text>

            <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that you are prepared for your event. Some events require a
                functional computer, webcam, speakers, and a microphone that will allow you to participate in the event.
                Additionally, you must ensure that your internet connection speed is sufficient to allow you to
                participate in your event. You will not be refunded if you are unable to attend or participate in your
                event because you do not have the minimum required conditions, including a stable and high-speed
                internet connection. For more information on minimum requirements and preparing for your event, please
                refer to our<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>support section.</p>

            <x-text as="h2" theme="h3">Your Behavior During an Event</x-text>

            <p>If you behave in a sexually explicit, violent, invasive, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate manner
                during an event, your event and your entire order may be canceled or terminated, and you will not
                receive a refund.</p>
